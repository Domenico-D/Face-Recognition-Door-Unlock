# Face-Recognition-Door-Unlock
Uses the python face_recognition python library, to unlock a door.

My robotics team had a simple problem, we could not open the door to our workshop without going to a different floor to ask
the school secretary for a key. So we decided that we would take matters into our own hands and build a mechanism to solve
our issue. Using a Raspberry Pi, a camera, a motor speed controller, a brushed DC motor and some 3D printing we solved our problem
a few hours later. I wrote a script that recognizes the faces of lead members whose pictures were previously taken and then spins the 
door mechanism enough to open the door.
